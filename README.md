# Frontend Mentor - IP address tracker

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.
The challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations
## users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

I have built this project with ReactJS. I took this project to assess my ReactJS skill while learning it.
